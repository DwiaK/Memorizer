# Memorizer

This is my second project made with ReactJS.

## What is the project ?

It's a memorizing game to practice your skills in determinated activity.

## How it Works ?

First of all the user are supposed to create a deck or import one. The deck that will be selected by the user contains cards with the content that the user wants to learn. When a deck is selected, the cards will appear on the screen containing the deck name, the content inside the card and a button named "Reveal". When the user click on Reveal it will appear the content behind the card, in other words, the answer for some question or traslation of some word.

## What did I used in this Project ?

In this project I tried to practice some things I've learned in ReactJS and Styled Components. I used MVC design pattern to organize the project to make it better to read and edit the code.
